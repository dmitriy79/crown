## How to upgrade

The basic procedure is to shutdown your existing version, replace the 
executable with the new version, and restart. This is true for both wallets
and masternodes/systemnodes. The exact procedure depends on how you setup
the wallet and/or node in the first place. If you use a managed hosting 
service for your node(s) it is probable they will upgrade them for you, 
but you will need to upgrade your wallet. There is no protocol version 
change in this release so if your MN/SN is updated quickly enough it will 
remain active and you won't need to isue a start-alias for it.

## What's new

v0.13.4 features 5 main changes over the previous v0.13.2.0 version:
* sync problem fixed
* immature MN/SN rewards and staking rewards show as immature in the
  wallet overview
* address labels from before v0.13 display correctly
* reduced memory usage
* enhancements to the installation script and the watchdog script is
  now part of the release
