Building Crown

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at https://crownplatform.com/wallet/. Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-\*.md for instructions on building crownd, the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference implementation of Crown.
